# ðŸ“Œ Clean Code Principles and Software Design

This repository contains my personal notes and practical exercises from the *Clean Code* and *Software Design Principles* course.

The course aims to enhance software development skills by adopting best practices for writing cleaner, maintainable, and efficient code.

## ðŸ“– Course Topics

âœ… **Fundamentals of Clean Code** and technical debt management.  
âœ… **Best practices for naming variables, methods, and classes**, improving code readability and expressiveness.  
âœ… **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles**, applied through exercises.  
âœ… **SOLID principles**, essential for scalable and modular software design:
